          Food donations are received from the Midwest Food Bank, plus much of
          the food (unused or close dated products) is picked up each week by
          Heart of Illinois Harvest volunteers from grocery stores, restaurants,
          and schools. Loaves and Fish also accepts donations of non-perishable
          food items and toiletries for our guests to take home. Volunteers work
          during the week, taking in, warehousing, and organizing donations

          Porch Pantry -- Kelli Martin
        </h2>
        <p>
          Porch Pantry was started in March 2020, by Kelli and Charles Martin on
          their front porch. According to Charles, “We thought it would last a
          few months and be over. What we found in serving the Peoria area was
          friendship, chosen family, community, and love for our neighbors.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Mission statement: Porch Pantry is where we put love into action.
          Porch Pantry of Peoria, Illinois, works to connect people, using the
          talents and skills of many to gather, create and give resources to
          those in need. Every item of food, clothing, household goods and
          hygiene products is love in action. Porch Pantry promotes
          self-sufficiency, dignity, Unity, Love for Your Neighbor, Community
          Awareness and Involvement. We are changing the world, one by one.
        </p>
        <p>
          Today, Porch Pantry feeds on the average 50 people a day. Families,
          veterans, houseless and people who have fallen on hard times have
          become the Martins extended family. This act of love is funded by the
          goodness of the Martins and donations from both individuals and
          agencies in the Peoria Area. The fight to feed the hungry is never
          ending.
