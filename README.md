This is a refactor of the website for the Community Festival of Nativities.
This Readme will be updated as the refactor progresses

I have implemented the surveys in about 70% of functionality, but I need to implement Auth0 to be able to finish them.
Routing is also finished with the need for designs and things.
I have created a new email to handle authentication control as well as stripe and whatever other things that I need to implement.
